	<p>I'm currently a PhD researcher at the <a class="block-link" href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Manchester</a> working on machine learning optimisation of manufacturing operations in chemical engineering.</p>
	<p>Alongside my research, I enjoy working on side projects. The biggest of those being my goal to climb all 214 of the Lake District Wainwrights, and my accompanying website <a class="block-link" href="/project/wainroutes">Wainroutes.</a></p>
